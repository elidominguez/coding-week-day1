        <p>Hi there! I'm Eli Domínguez, a passionate UX/UI designer living in Barcelona. I was a marketer for six years and I worked in tech companies, mostly focused in HR & recruiting.  
            <br>Working as a <strong>Director in a tech company</strong>, I was the liaison between Marketing and Product, and I started to be really interested in the way teams build digital products. So I left everything behind and made a career change: I wanted to be part of the research, ideation and design of new products. That's why I joined IronHack for the UX/UI Bootcamp!</p>
